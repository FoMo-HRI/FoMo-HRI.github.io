<!-- # Human – Large Language Model Interaction

In this workshop, we want to gather, combine, compare, and share
insights and knowledge across the wide HRI community on the pit-
falls and opportunities that the application of LLMs in HRI research
can present. 

It is the aim of this workshop to reflect on the growing
trend of applying LLMs for addressing challenging robotics and/or
artificial intelligence tasks, with a particular emphasis on those
where human interactions form a key component.
