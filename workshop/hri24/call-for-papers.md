<!-- # Human – Large Language Model Interaction -->

The Human - Large Language Model Interaction workshop aims at bringing together researchers and industry experts across all disciplines in the fields of Human-Robot Interaction and Artificial Intelligence for an interactive and interdisciplinary discussion around the enormous opportunities and challenges that emerge from integrating Large Language Models in the interactive, conversational and reasoning abilities of robots.   

The workshop aims to provide an important venue to encourage debate around issues concerning the deployment of Large Language Models empowered solutions for human-robot interaction. This will be an opportunity to share and discuss ideas, worries, strategies, insights and findings around the application of Large Language Models in interaction scenarios.   

The primary audience of the workshop are researchers in the field of Human-Robot Interaction, Conversational Agents, Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence, and Social Robotics, but we invite everyone with an interest or concern about the use of LLMs for HRI to join.

The workshop will take place on March 11, 2024 at Boulder, Colorado (USA) during the [19th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI 2024)](https://humanrobotinteraction.org/2024/)

## Topics of Interest
We invite research regarding contributions about (but not limited to) the following topics of interest:

- Applications for LLMs in HRI 
- Multimodal social interaction research with LLMs 
- Planning tasks with LLMs for HRI 
- Reasoning and knowledge representation using LLMs 
- Decision making and grounding using LLMs 
- Situated and Multiparty interactions with LLMs 
- Explainability of LLM-powered interactive robots 
- Reliability and Safety of LLM-powered interactive robots 
- Trustworthiness of LLM-powered interactive robots

<!-- While we are generally interested in any topics related to the development, implementation, training, evaluation, and deployment of Large Language Models in Human-Robot Interaction scenarios.  -->
<!-- Please consider whether your work would present a better fit in our ***friend workshop [Scarecrows in Oz (LLMs in HRI)](https://scarecrows-hri.github.io/)*** before submitting. -->

This workshop is generally focused on any topics related to the development, implementation, training, evaluation, and deployment of Large Language Models in Human-Robot Interaction scenarios.
If your work focuses on opportunities, risks, and guidelines for the use and reporting of LLMs in HRI, please also consider our companion workshop, ***[Scarecrows in Oz: LLMs in HRI](https://scarecrows-hri.github.io)***.

<!-- Submission Instructions: -->

Participants are invited to submit 2-pages extended abstracts on research related to the topics described above using [EasyChair link](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hllmi24). 

We explicitly encourage the submission of position papers to discuss with the community or papers describing work in progress, novel ideas or new approaches related to the use of LLMs in HRI.   

All manuscripts must be submitted in PDF format and will be peer-reviewed based on relevance to the workshop. 
Authors are asked to adhere to the submission guidelines outlined by HRI2024. 

Submissions should be made using the [ACM template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template); Overleaf provides an appropriate [template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-primary-article-template/wbvnghjbzwpc) that may be used. 


The authors of the accepted papers will present their work in the format of lightning talks or posters during the workshop. The accepted papers will be published on the workshop website.
