<!-- # Human – Large Language Model Interaction -->

The Human - Large Language Model Interaction workshop aims at bringing together researchers and industry experts across all disciplines in the fields of Human-Robot Interaction and Artificial Intelligence for an interactive and interdisciplinary discussion around the enormous opportunities and challenges that emerge from integrating Large Language Models in the interactive, conversational and reasoning abilities of robots.   

The workshop aims to provide an important venue to encourage debate around issues concerning the deployment of Large Language Models empowered solutions for human-robot interaction. This will be an opportunity to share and discuss ideas, worries, strategies, insights and findings around the application of Large Language Models in interaction scenarios.   

The primary audience of the workshop are researchers in the field of Human-Robot Interaction, Conversational Agents, Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence, and Social Robotics, but we invite everyone with an interest or concern about the use of LLMs for HRI to join.

The workshop will take place on March 11, 2024 at Boulder, Colorado (USA) during the [19th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI 2024)](https://humanrobotinteraction.org/2024/)
