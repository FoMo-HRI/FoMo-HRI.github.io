subtitle: "Human – Foundation Models Interaction: A Focus On Multimodal Information"
description: In this workshop, we want to gather, combine, compare, and share insights and knowledge across the wide HRI community on the pitfalls and opportunities that the application of Foundation Models, including LLMs, VLMs, multimodal models and generative AI, can present for HRI research.

<!-- # Human – Large Language Model Interaction -->

The Human - Foundation Model Interaction (FoMo-HRI) workshop fosters interdisciplinary discussions around the applications and opportunities that emerge from integrating foundation models in HRI. 

The workshop provides an important venue to encourage debate around issues concerning multi-modality, LLM grounding and real-world deployments as well as issues around safety, reliability, trustworthiness, and the ethical deployment of such models. 

We hope discussions will inform and guide the HRI community towards research that can leverage the potential of foundation models to enable multi-modal human-robot communication.  

The workshop will take place on August 25, 2025 at Eindhoven, the Netherlands during the [IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN 2025)](https://www.ro-man2025.org/)

## Topics of Interest
Topics of interest are anything related to the development, implementation, training/fine tuning, evaluation, and deployment of Foundation Models in Human-Robot Interaction scenarios. 
We invite research regarding contributions about (but not limited to) the following topics of interest:

- Challenges and opportunities of using in LLMs, VLMs, and GenAI models
- LLMs, VLMs, and GenAI models applications for HRI
- Using foundation models in multi-modal HRI research
- Reasoning and knowledge representation using LLMs, VLMs, and GenAI models
- Embodied and social grounding using LLMs, VLMs, and GenAI models
- Foundation models for planning and decision making
- Explainability of LLMs, VLMs, and GenAI powered interactive robots
- Reliability and Safety of LLMs, VLMs, and GenAI powered interactive robots
- Evaluation of LLMs, VLMs, and GenAI powered interactive robots
- Trustworthiness, Ethics, Privacy, and Data Security considerations

<!-- While we are generally interested in any topics related to the development, implementation, training, evaluation, and deployment of Large Language Models in Human-Robot Interaction scenarios.  -->
<!-- Please consider whether your work would present a better fit in our ***friend workshop [Scarecrows in Oz (LLMs in HRI)](https://scarecrows-hri.github.io/)*** before submitting. -->

# [](#submission)Submission Instructions

<!-- Submission Instructions: -->

Participants are invited to submit **2-pages extended abstracts** (maximum 4 pages including references) on research related to the topics described above. All manuscripts must be submitted in PDF format and will be peer-reviewed based on relevance to the workshop. 

We explicitly encourage the submission of position papers to discuss with the community or papers describing work in progress, novel ideas or new approaches related to the use of Foundation models in HRI.   

Submitted papers will remain the property of the authors and will not be formally published or catalogued. Authors are free to resubmit their work elsewhere.

The accepted papers (with the authors permission) will be made available on the workshop website. 

The authors of the accepted papers will present their work in the format of lightning talks or posters during the workshop. At least one author of an accepted contribution would be expected to register for the workshop.
