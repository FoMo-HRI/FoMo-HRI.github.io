subtitle: "Human – Foundation Models Interaction: A Focus On Multimodal Information"
description: In this workshop, we want to gather, combine, compare, and share insights and knowledge across the wide HRI community on the pitfalls and opportunities that the application of Foundation Models, including LLMs, VLMs, multimodal models and generative AI, can present for HRI research.

The Human - Foundation Model Interaction (FoMo-HRI) workshop fosters interdisciplinary discussions around the applications and opportunities that emerge from integrating foundation models in HRI. 

The workshop provides an important venue to encourage debate around issues concerning multi-modality, LLM grounding and real-world deployments as well as issues around safety, reliability, trustworthiness, and the ethical deployment of such models. 

We hope discussions will inform and guide the HRI community towards research that can leverage the potential of foundation models to enable multi-modal human-robot communication. 

The workshop will take place on Monday August 25, 2025 at Eindhoven, the Netherlands during the [IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN 2025)](https://www.ro-man2025.org/).
The conference will be hosted on the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) campus .
